            <h3>How Resident Evil Revolutionized Gaming</h3>

            <!-- Paragraphs describing games -->
            <p>
                Resident Evil helped define the survival horror genre by focusing on tension, fear,
                and limited resources. Instead of giving players constant action, the game forced
                them to think carefully and survive with what they had.
            </p>

            <p>
                The game also used cinematic camera angles and atmosphere to tell its story, making
                players feel like they were inside a horror movie. This approach influenced many
                future games and showed that video games could create powerful emotional experiences.
